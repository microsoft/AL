This GitHub repository is dedicated to handling issues and feedback for the latest Developer Preview releases of the AL development tools for Dynamics 365 Business Central. 

We suggest that you open a support case or file a bug in Collaborate, to ensure that all Business Central users benefit from your catch as soon as possible.

You can open Support Request to CSS through PartnerSource portal or contact your Service Account Manager (SAM) in the local subsidiary to understand what is included in your contract as of support incident and PAH (Partner Advisory Hours). Your SAM might also step by step direct you how to open a support request or how to get credentials if this is the first time for you / your company.
